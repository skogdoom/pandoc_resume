**My Cool Side Project**
For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list can be used to have named items.

* These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the indentation levels in the markdown source.
* Second item.

**Open Source**
List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js** (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally your idea...



Languages
----------------------------------------

* English (native speaker)
* ???
* This is what a nested list looks like.
